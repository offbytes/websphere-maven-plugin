  Specify the artifact you want deployed to IBM WebSphere Liberty Profile. This path is relative to the job that's
    executing under Jenkins(for deploying a specific module use "modules/[module name]/**/lastSuccessful/**/*.war" or use
    "modules/**/lastSuccessful/**/*.ear" to deploy all ears associated with the current job). Any
    artifact that WebSphere Liberty Profile supports can be deployed from this Jenkins plugin.
