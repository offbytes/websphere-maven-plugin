  The "Client Key File Path" is the absolute location on this server to the client key file. The default one that ships
  with WebSphere can be found at "[WAS_INSTALL_PATH]/profiles/[PROFILE_TO_CONNECT_TO]/etc/DummyClientKeyFile.jks". This file should
  be copied to this server and its path specified in this input field. Be sure to use an absolute path!
