<div>
  The "Generated EAR Level" is only used when deploying WAR artifacts to WebSphere. This option will be used to automatically wrap the WAR artifact in an EAR
  and deploy it to WebSphere. The context root will be the name of the WAR artifact (similar to other containers, i.e. test.war will use '/test' as the web context).
