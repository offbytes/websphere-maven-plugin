  The "Client Trust File Path" is the absolute location on this server to the client trust file. The default one that ships
  with WebSphere can be found at "[WAS_INSTALL_PATH]/profiles/[PROFILE_TO_CONNECT_TO]/etc/DummyClientTrustFile.jks". This file should
  be copied to this server and its path specified in this input field. Be sure to use an absolute path! If WebSphere is located
  in a remote location, this trust file should also be imported into the ../jre/lib/security/cacerts file since it is a self signed
  certificate provided by WebSphere.
